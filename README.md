# No-More-Explore
Google Chrome extension to remove Reels and the whole Explore page.

Less than 100 lines to remove the "Explore" and "Reels" section on the Instagram web client. After deleting the app from my phone and only accessing 
the webclient to react to messages or stories from friends I use the Instagram as a whole 90% less than before.

### Usage

Clone the repo and follow the steps outlined [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked).
Make sure to compile the code to Javascript before: ```yarn build```.
